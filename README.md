Camera Classifier
Camera Classifier is a Python-based application that allows users to classify images captured from their webcam. The application leverages a simple machine learning model (LinearSVC) to categorize images into two predefined classes. The GUI is built using Tkinter, and OpenCV is used to handle the webcam input.

Features
Real-time Webcam Capture: The application uses the webcam to capture images in real time.
Image Classification: Classify images into two user-defined categories using a trained SVM model.
Automatic Prediction: Option to enable auto-prediction mode for continuous classification.
Reset Functionality: Easily reset the model and start a new classification session.
GUI with Tkinter: User-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction.
